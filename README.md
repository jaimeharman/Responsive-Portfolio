# Responsive Portfolio

I created a responsive portfolio utilizing Bootstrap v4.5 with three html pages: about me, portfolio and a contact page. Requirements included a functional/deployable application, use of navbar, working links, semantic html and components/grid of Bootstrap. This page will be used to upload projects completed in this course and as a personal portfolio to show future potential employers.
